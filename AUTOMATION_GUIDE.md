# ReviewResponder - Automated Review Response System

## ü§ñ Automation Operation Guide

This guide explains the complete operation for listening to reviews and automatically responding via AI to Google My Business reviews.

## üìã System Overview

The ReviewResponder system provides **automated AI-powered responses** to Google My Business reviews through multiple detection methods:

### üîÑ How Automation Works

1. **Review Detection**
   - **Webhook Listening**: Real-time notifications from Google My Business API
   - **Periodic Polling**: Scheduled checks for new reviews every 30 seconds
   - **Manual Triggers**: On-demand review fetching

2. **AI Response Generation**
   - **OpenAI GPT-4 Integration**: Generates contextual responses based on review content
   - **Tone Customization**: Professional, friendly, or custom response tones
   - **Rating-Based Logic**: Different response strategies for different star ratings

3. **Automatic Posting**
   - **Google My Business API**: Posts AI-generated responses automatically
   - **Review Validation**: Ensures responses are appropriate before posting
   - **Error Handling**: Retry mechanisms and failure notifications

## üöÄ Setting Up Automation

### Step 1: Configure Credentials
```bash
1. Open the ReviewResponder app at http://localhost:5174
2. Click "Configure Credentials" 
3. Enter your Google OAuth credentials:
   - Client ID
   - Client Secret
   - Redirect URI (http://localhost:3001/api/google/callback)
4. Save credentials
```

### Step 2: Connect Google My Business
```bash
1. Select your Google Business Account from dropdown
2. Choose the specific business location
3. Verify connection status shows "Connected"
```

### Step 3: Start Automation
```bash
1. Navigate to Settings Panel
2. Enable "Auto-Respond to Reviews"
3. Configure response settings:
   - Response tone (Professional/Friendly/Custom)
   - Rating filters (respond to 1-5 star reviews)
   - Response delay (immediate or scheduled)
4. Click "Start Automation"
```

## üì° Real-Time Webhook Operations

### Google My Business Webhook Setup

The system listens for real-time review notifications through Google's webhook system:

```javascript
// Webhook endpoint: http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/google
// Supported events:
- review.create (new review posted)
- review.updated (existing review modified)
- location.updated (business info changed)
```

### Webhook Processing Flow

1. **Incoming Webhook** ‚Üí Google sends notification to our endpoint
2. **Event Parsing** ‚Üí Extract review data and metadata
3. **Validation** ‚Üí Verify webhook signature and content
4. **Automation Trigger** ‚Üí Start AI response generation
5. **Real-time Notification** ‚Üí Update frontend dashboard immediately

### Testing Webhooks

You can test the webhook functionality:

```bash
# Test webhook endpoint
POST http://localhost:3001/api/webhooks/test

# This simulates a new 5-star review and triggers the automation
```

## üîÑ Automation Process Details

### When a New Review is Detected:

1. **Review Analysis**
   ```javascript
   {
     "reviewId": "unique_review_identifier",
     "starRating": 1-5,
     "reviewer": { "displayName": "Customer Name" },
     "comment": "Customer's review text",
     "createTime": "2025-01-20T12:00:00Z",
     "locationName": "business_location_id"
   }
   ```

2. **AI Response Generation**
   - Send review to OpenAI GPT-4
   - Include business context and tone preferences
   - Generate appropriate response (50-200 characters)

3. **Response Validation**
   - Check for inappropriate content
   - Ensure response is relevant to review
   - Verify character limits

4. **Automatic Posting**
   - Post response to Google My Business
   - Update review record with response
   - Send success/failure notification

### Example AI Response Flow:

```javascript
// 5-Star Review Input:
"Amazing service! The staff was so helpful and friendly."

// AI Generated Response:
"Thank you so much for your wonderful feedback! We're thrilled you had such a positive experience with our team. We look forward to serving you again soon!"

// 1-Star Review Input:
"Terrible experience. Waited 30 minutes and staff was rude."

// AI Generated Response:
"We sincerely apologize for your poor experience. This doesn't reflect our usual standards. Please contact us directly at [contact] so we can make this right and improve our service."
```
